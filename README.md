## Hi there 👋 I'm Gyula

- ⚡ Fun fact: I made  sentence generator for [XKCD#1930](https://xkcd.com/1930/) you can find it on my page [here](https://gyk.ro/random-stuff/xkcd-calendar-facts/) and the code [here](https://gist.github.com/gardient/2085f645706090426517c31cbaa9417d#file-xkcd-calendar-fact-generator-js-L176)

## Awesome

here is a list of stuff that I use, in no particular order, mostly for myself to remember them

- [seashells](https://seashells.io/) - stream your cli output to the web, and check from anywhere
- [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) - send notifications to your phone, again from pretty much anywhere, you can even host it yourself
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - IYKYK
- [watchtower](https://watchtower.nickfedor.com/) - a fork, because this is still in dev
- [slash](https://github.com/yourselfhosted/slash)
- [gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) - GOGS fork, generally awesome
- [x-cmd](https://www.x-cmd.com/) - awesome if you want to have a quick way to access your favourite commands and not necessarily remember to install them

### windows apps

- [ScreenBox media player](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntsnmsvcb5l?hl=en-us&gl=US)
- [ImageGlass](https://imageglass.org/)
- [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)
- [Files app](https://files.community/) - not using this anymore, not worth the memory for me

### things I want to try/set up

- NetBird
- Rustdesk
